# Whistlepost Content Management

Whistlepost provides an opinionated content management structure to help with rapid site development. Using
this structure you can have a basic site up and running in minutes.

## Overview

Whistlepost content consists of a tree of folders containing JSON documents that describe the site configuration and
content structure. Site configuration files provide rendering hints such as banners, references and shared footers,
